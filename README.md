# Queue_Operations-Array
C Program For Queue Operations Using Array

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

To implement a queue using array, create an array arr of size n and take two variables front and rear both of which will be initialized to 0 which means the queue is currently empty. Element rear is the index upto which the elements are stored in the array and front is the index of the first element of the array.

The GCC File Also Have Been Pushed.
